Terrorism
The risk of terrorism has been evolving for the last two decades, making it difficult and subjective to assess.
Its inventive and adaptive nature undermines probabilistic modelling inferred from the past. Therefore
assessing the plausibility of a specific type of terrorist attack in the future largely relies on expert judgment.
Potential threats are NBCR terrorist attacks (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, Radiological) and other
nonconventional terrorist attacks on computer systems and industrial installations (Cyber terrorism, Electro
Magnetic Pulse (EMP)).

"The survey results indicate that a lack of skilled talent
available for hire along with challenges retaining current
talent, including at the highest ranks of the organization,
have been a growing concern in the last five years.
Last year, for instance, after not making the top five list of
key risks the prior year, the talent shortage made a dramatic
appearance as the second-ranked risk concern, upstaged
only by restrictive regulations related to the pandemic.
In the latest survey, succession challenges and the ability
to attract and retain top talent sits at the top of the list
of risks, though it comes at an interesting time for the
industry. In recent months, a number of TMT organizations
have announced layoffs and hiring freezes, citing inflation,
rising cost of wages and benefits, and a need to eliminate
less value-added resources to focus on profitability.
The changing labor model spurred by the pandemic likely has
something to do with the talent challenges board members

Preface
Last year's Global Risks Report warned that a
divergent economic recovery from the COVID-19
pandemic risked deepening divisions at a time
when collaboration was urgently required to address
looming global challenges. Yet despite hard-learned
lessons around the interdependence of global risks,
few would have anticipated the extent of instability
that would soon unfold, this time driven by a new war
in Europe.
The health and economic aftereffects of the pandemic
have quickly spiraled into compounding crises.
Carbon emissions have climbed, as the postpandemic global economy fired back up. Food and
energy have become weaponized by the war in
Ukraine, sending inflation soaring to levels not seen in
decades, globalizing a cost-of-living crisis and fueling
social unrest. The resulting shift in monetary policy
marks the end of an economic era defined by easy
access to cheap debt and will have vast ramifications
for governments, companies and individuals, widening
inequality within and between countries.",0,0

"In 2023,
Putin can't afford to be that cautious.
Nearly one year since it invaded Ukraine and promised quick victory, Russia has no good remaining military options to win
the war. Moscow will continue shelling Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, but that won't affect the military balance
on the ground. Russia can also launch an offensive with newly mobilized troops this spring, but a lack of training and strong
Ukrainian defenses will limit their effectiveness.
Russia also has little leverage left over either the United States or Europe. While it will cut off most remaining gas flows to
Europe, increasing European public support for negotiations, this won't prompt a rollback of sanctions (with nine rounds
now unanimously approved by all 27 EU member states) or undermine military support for Ukraine (most of which comes
from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the most steadfastly anti-Russian EU states).
Russia won't back down. Having raised the war's stakes by mobilizing hundreds of thousands of Russian troops and annexing
four Ukrainian regions (much of which they didn'tand don'tactually occupy), Putin remains under intense pressure
to, at a minimum, control most of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.",0,0
"To remain competitive

Quantify risks beyond benchmarking
Benchmarking reports can be helpful, but are by their nature
backward looking. Tech companies should conduct scenario
analysis and look to other industries to truly understand the
magnitude of their changing risks.
Understand your entire risk ecosystem
The global digital supply chain requires technology
companies to understand all the interdependent risks across
their ecosystem. A thorough review does not stop with
analyzing your own risks, but requires mapping those of your
vendors, partners, suppliers, customers, and platforms.
Focus on enabling growth
From streamlining contract negotiations to enabling new

enable growth and try to identify and address problems that
can derail growth.

Energy and food crisis
Energy and food remain the main drivers of inflation.
The Russian government's war in Ukraine and the risk
of further instability from Moscow in 2023 will continue
to cause disruptions and, in turn, broader economic
woes. Absent a durable solution to the conflict, the
reshaping of global food and energy supply chains

economic crisis. Geography will matter too. Countries

reliable external supplies can survive. And the rest will
likely struggle.

"A macroeconomic risk ""the
adoption of digital technologies"" which also ranks second
on the 2032 list of top risks for this industry, provides insight
as to why leaders of energy and utilities firms are concerned
that resistance to organizational change may restrict their
company's ability to make timely and necessary adjustments
to its core operations and business model.
Energy companies are under pressure to transform their
operations and take advantage of technologies like artificial
intelligence and natural language processing to increase
efficiency and decision-making. Given that workers
with these skills are in short supply in the labor market,
energy businesses will need to upskill and reskill existing
employees to work with these new tools to fully realize
their value proposition and not all staff will welcome
that change or be able to adapt to it. Also, as organizations
automate more processes, some jobs will become obsolete
or change dramatically. All of these dynamics, if not handled
well, can impact organizational culture negatively and
hinder companies' efforts to transform.
Two risks that share fourth place on the 2032 list are
closely tied to ""the adoption of digital technologies"" risk.",0,1

"And worryingly, economic policy is
perceived by experts as a rising source
of risk, with output slowing in China
and Europe and the US struggling
to get a grip on surging prices.
Against this backdrop, it's not
surprising that geopolitical tensions
have jumped in importance for risk
managers, rising to second position
in this year's expert survey. But it's
also remarkable what hasn't changed,
despite unprecedented economic
and geopolitical developments.
For the fourth time in the last five
years, climate change is front of mind
for risk experts surveyed by IPSOS.
Extreme weather events, driven by
rising temperatures and sea levels,
are heightening risks in areas such as
energy and food security.
Immediately below climate change
and geopolitics comes cyber security,
which has been a top-three risk since
2018. And rightly so, given the growing
importance of major tech companies
in shaping global commerce, politics,
geopolitics and, indeed, our daily
lives.
With all these challenges looming,
the need for coordination between
policymakers and private-sector
actors is critically important. Insurers
can play a critical role in fostering
cooperation by providing innovative
risk management tools and helping
businesses to soberly assess future
risks.",1,0

Call to Action ESG
BY CHRIS WRIGHT
GLOBAL LEADER, ESG STEERING COMMITTEE, PROTIVITI
With issues related to the ""S"" of ESG rated highly in our
survey and matters related to the ""E"" and ""G"" evolving, many
organizations have sustainability reporting and its related
operational activities and risks on their radar. ESG has its
share of critics and some ESG initiatives are under increased
financial pressure as CEOs and investors focus more sharply
on the risk-reward balance in the face of economic and
geopolitical headwinds. The near-term challenge related
to ESG is navigating uncertainties in the marketplace while
keeping an eye on positioning the organization and its values,
reputation and brand for the long term. To that end, the
following steps merit consideration:
Prioritize with a balanced perspective. Give the rising
cost of capital its due consideration when evaluating and
prioritizing ESG initiatives. At the same time, be mindful
of regulatory and stakeholder interests as the focus
on preserving financial vibrancy intensifies. View ESG
considerations the same way everything else involving
allocation of capital and the future is viewed. For
example, what is the strategic opportunity, what are the
risks and how is return on capital measured?",0,0

Other top risks
Among the top 10 risks in 2023, CPG and retail executives
cited the impact of social issues and priorities surrounding
DEI initiatives on their ability to attract and retain talent;
resistance to change in culture; third-party risks; and
geopolitical shifts, regional conflicts, and instability in
governmental regimes or expansion of global terrorism.
Asked to identify top risk issues they expect over the next
decade, CPG and retail respondents cited succession
challenges and the ability to attract and retain top talent,
the speed of disruptive innovations, sustaining customer
loyalty and retention, and supply chain concerns.
Hospitality industry
Having shaken off the crippling effects of the pandemic,
and with global travel and tourism continuing to rebound,
the hospitality industry is expecting substantial growth
in 2023, led by a strong appetite from vacationers and
business travelers to spend even in the face of rising
inflation.",0,0

Modern (disruptive) technologies, including big data and artificial intelligence (AI), digitisation, automation and robotics are boosting economic
growth, performing repetitive tasks, and making processes and systems faster, cheaper and less prone to errors. Autonomous machines are
increasingly being integrated into many areas of society and AI is also enabling a shift towards the automation of more value-added tasks. The
integration of these new technologies into human societies comes with numerous benefits, including assisting people in their daily lives, for
example by providing an improved customer experience (including greater product and provider choice, and speed of delivery); by improving
healthcare; and by facilitating social interactions. However, there are many uncertain consequences of their adoption, including replacing jobs
currently performed by people and creating the need for re-skilling of some sections of the working population. In addition, changes may be
required to education systems over the longer term. The increased integration of technology into daily life also raises questions around the
equal access of all sections of society to digital resources, data security and ethics relating to the use of AI algorithms.",0,0

"Healthcare organizations are often targeted by attackers,
as they know the environments are overly complex, the
amount of sensitive (and thus valuable) data is vast, and
the overall maturity of security controls and programs
tends to be lower compared to other industries. This makes
healthcare organizations ripe for attacks and extortion.
Combine these cyber threats with a continuing expansion
of the amount of data being collected from patients and
members, and the industry has a risk area that many
healthcare organizations know will continue to require
ongoing investment, improvement and monitoring.
As the industry emerges from the pandemic, healthcare
continues to operate in a tumultuous environment.
Mergers and acquisitions are rampant, with many
organizations combining both provider and payer
functions under one corporation in the hope of expanding
their patient and customer delivery footprint. This
creates an extremely complex regulatory compliance
environment, as data that is collected is used for different
purposes across organizational business lines and units.
These newly created, complex organizations share

In view of these long-term requirements for a just

a coordinated fiscal policy response, for example,
repurposing the 200bn+ of Next Generation

SURE (the EU's temporary Support to mitigate
Unemployment Risks in an Emergency program) as
a blueprint (backed by government guarantees).",0,0
"In this new energy landscape, control
of intellectual property and technology transfer will be

Government and business responses to energy security
fears caused by price spikes and supply constraints will

just China and India that have increased their short-term
reliance on coal in response to global natural gas prices
this year; Germany has done the same. Governments
in Beijing, New Delhi and Berlin remain committed
to long-term emissions reduction; but keeping the lights
on and powering their economies is a first priority,
even if this means huge fiscal support and the
imposition of efficiency measures.
Governments are falling short in setting the agenda.
The financial industry can play its part with disclosure

of climate change on food production. However,
shortages in water and metals and minerals
cannot be avoided. Persistently high commodity
prices slow climate mitigation despite ambitions
and add to inflationary pressures in broader
value chains, while water stress leads to a
growing, but comparatively contained, health and
humanitarian crisis in developing nations.
Resource constraints the danger of
divergent distress: current crises draw focus
and slow climate action, exposing the most
vulnerable countries to hunger and energy
shocks, even as countries cooperate to
partially address constraints. In the absence of
intervention, the water and mineral shortages
experienced in the Resource collaboration
scenario act as a multiplier to broader risks. A
multi-resource, humanitarian crisis emerges in
developing markets as food and water resources
are impacted by the physical consequences of
climate change, alongside global disruptions to
trade, political stability and economic growth.",0,1

Emerging risks
changing in nature
For Greg Schlegel, founder of the Supply
Chain Risk Consortium in the US and Adjunct
Professor for teaching enterprise risk
management for Villanova University's
EMBA programme, first the pandemic and
now the conflict in Europe have underlined
a fundamental shift in the nature of
emerging risks.
Instead of being siloed into the kind of
categories that appear on most risk registers,
such threats cut across all business areas
and are fundamentally outside of the
organisation's control. Low-probability,
high-impact events such as natural disasters,
political upheaval, inflation, pandemics
and wars may turn out to be more common
than people think. Supply chains not only
face disruptions from geopolitical tension,
but from shortages of raw materials and
components from grain to computer chips
and from a lack of workers following the
pandemic and events such as Brexit.",0,0

Resource Rivalries:
Four Emerging Futures
3
Chapter one and Chapter two highlighted newly
emerging and rapidly accelerating risks over the
current, two- and 10-year time frame to provide
analysis on risks currently unfolding or those that
may become the next global shock. However, these
present and future risks can also interact with each
other to form a ""polycrisis"" a cluster of related
global risks with compounding effects, such that the
overall impact exceeds the sum of each part.1
Scenario thinking can be a useful tool to enable
better anticipation of polycrises, as key drivers
can interact in unanticipated ways and lead to
unexpected consequences. Bearing this in mind,
this chapter explores how connections between the
emerging risks outlined in previous sections may
evolve by 2030. This year, we explore Resource
Rivalries - a potential cluster of interrelated
environmental, geopolitical and socioeconomic risks
relating to the supply of and demand for natural
resources.",0,1
"For example, while only one-fifth of our survey
respondents listed bodily injury as a risk of high concern, today there is limited data showing
the potential longer term health implications arising from prolonged use of VR headsets.
There may also be physical injury risks if haptic wearables malfunction.
Additionally, the current lack of regulatory clarity leads to significant questions about
liabilities. For example, how is property defined in a virtual environment? And with many
transactions taking place using cryptocurrencies, insurance coverage for potential losses is
still being put to the test.
Further, there are questions about the regulatory oversight of assets in immersive
environments. For example, who is responsible and under which jurisdiction if a client's
avatar is assaulted by a malicious third-party actor inside a company's virtual store that
operates on a decentralized metaverse platform? Organizations need to stay on top of the
latest regulations and be aware of the potential reputational and legal repercussions of
operating in the metaverse.",1,0

"At the same time, it is unclear whether these decentralised cryptocurrencies
can coexist with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which are being considered by central banks
with multiple pilot projects and implementation programmes currently underway. As the digital financial
ecosystem continue to evolve, extreme volatility and liquidity issues of cryptocurrencies may persist, and in
the longer term there could be disintermediation risk if the widespread adoption of digital currencies allow
users to obtain access to banking services without going through the banks.

Misinformation
New digital abilities to manufacture faked contents (photos, videos, audio, text) are proliferating, and speed
and effortlessness to produce and distribute sophisticated fakes are increasing. Deep fakes (e.g. AI-enabled
simulated video) or fake news can be used for fraud, to harass individuals, defame social groups, blackmail
organizations or destabilize political systems and markets. For insurance, social engineering/cyber and
social unrest implications may be central, but there are also impacts on claims handling, and reputational

"Spurred by state aid and military
expenditure, as well as private investment, research
and development into emerging technologies will
continue at pace over the next decade, yielding
advancements in AI, quantum computing and
biotechnology, among other technologies. For
countries that can afford it, these technologies will
provide partial solutions to a range of emerging
crises, from addressing new health threats and a
crunch in healthcare capacity to scaling food security
and climate mitigation. For those that cannot,
inequality and divergence will grow. In all economies,
these technologies also bring risks, from widening
misinformation and disinformation to unmanageably
rapid churn in both blue- and white-collar jobs.
However, the rapid development and deployment
of new technologies, which often comes with
limited protocols governing their use, poses its
own set of risks. The ever-increasing intertwining
of technologies with the critical functioning of
societies is exposing populations to direct domestic
threats, including those that seek to shatter
societal functioning. Alongside a rise in cybercrime,
attempts to disrupt critical technology-enabled
resources and services will become more common,
with attacks anticipated against agriculture and
water, financial systems, public security, transport,
energy and domestic, space-based and undersea
communication infrastructure.",1,1

"For example, while advances
such as in personalized, genomic and proteomic
medicine can vastly improve health outcomes for
chronic and degenerative conditions, they come with
hefty price tags that may constrain widespread use;
gene therapies can cost upwards of $2 million.46 A

It is essential that we embed hard-earned lessons in
preparedness for the next iteration of health crises.
A continued focus on public health policy and
interventions can have outsized impacts at national

disease burden is, in fact, preventable.48 Realizing
public health gains will require governments and
business to promote the conditions that underpin

Geographic region analysis
Organizations with headquarters based in India, North America and Latin America indicate the greatest likelihood that they will
devote additional resources to risk management in 2023, with all signaling a significant increase relative to 2022. Organizations
headquartered in Australia/New Zealand and Europe indicate a reduced likelihood of additional investment in risk management
capabilities as compared to the 2022 results, perhaps caused by the increased investments they forecast for 2022 in our prior year
report. Organizations headquartered in Australia/New Zealand exhibit the largest decrease (from 7.09 in 2022 to 6.23 in 2023).

"Re-invigorating multilateral processes and
organizations is critical to the future of preparing for
and managing global risks.
Additionally, specific cooperation at sectoral, bilateral
and regional levels will become even more important
in this environment. Robust data exchange and
collaborative monitoring processes have already
been established for some global risks (natural
disasters, extreme weather events and terrorist
attacks, among others). Further, open-source data
and scenario development have helped increase
the effectiveness of individual risk responses, such
as the extensive work undertaken by the IPCC
to develop a range of climate scenarios that has
improved understanding, informed decarbonization
strategies and allowed for collective alignment on
science-based targets. However, efforts are more
nascent or non-existent in other areas, such as the
long-term trajectory and impact of transformative AI.
Greater collaboration across industries and between
countries in terms of coordinated funding, research
and data sharing is critical to help identify weak
signals of emerging threats at both a national and
global level.
In a complex risks outlook, there must be a better
balance between national preparedness and
global cooperation.",0,1

A series of calls to action
Our respondents reveal that the scope of global risks has
become more expansive, and the number of different
risks rated as top risk concerns is only growing in nature
and type. The level of uncertainty in today's marketplace
is rapidly evolving and presenting new risks that many
previously thought were unimaginable.
The ever-changing risk landscape and the overall perceived
magnitude and severity of risks should prompt boards
and senior executives to scrutinize closely the approaches
they use to remain focused on emerging risk issues and
to integrate those insights into strategic decision-making.
With near-term issues around economic uncertainty, labor
costs, recovering supply chains, and myriad people and
culture issues, organizations may tend to focus more on
getting through 2023. No doubt, sustaining financial health
in an economic downturn would be a priority. In such times,
postponing planned and discretionary investments

to an overwhelmed health system, and to let news of
a more severe variant get out given Xi's track record on
transparency. The world would have little or no time to
prepare for a deadlier virus.
A second area of concern is the economy, where Xi's drive
for state control will produce arbitrary decisions and policy
volatility. China's economy is in a fragile state after two years
of harsh Covid-19 controls. Forced deleveraging efforts and
plummeting homebuyer and market sentiment have ground
growth in the critical real estate sector to a halt, depleting
local government revenue. Debt defaults threaten to spread
to the broader financial sector. It has long been the case
that more global GDP growth was coming from a politically
riskier market as China's economic footprint expanded. But
in 2023, China's outlook is even more important, given the

new risk questions
The opportunities in the metaverse are enormous, from allowing customers to virtually try
on clothes to use in human or avatar form, to providing more immersive customer service
experiences, to improving the reach and delivery of education, to leveraging AR technology
to increase access to healthcare. And as AR/VR headsets and haptic wearables become
more technologically developed and more affordable, adoption of the metaverse is likely to
become more widespread.
But organizations that have already established or are considering establishing a presence in
the metaverse as are more than a third of our survey respondents need to think beyond
the opportunities and consider the fast-evolving set of risks.

"One of the major
shifts likely for business leaders will be to
expand its perspective beyond the Western lens
in terms of anticipating where ESG problems will
arise.
In addition, as ESG standards mature, there may be
more uncomfortable conversations about regional
and cultural expectations for each ESG category
particularly the ""S"". For local companies only
operating in one region or cultural zone, this will be a
more limited risk. For global companies, however,
navigating this field will require careful
(and conscious) trade-offs. The nuances of this
outlook make it even more necessary that
functions like corporate affairs, risk
management and sustainability teams be included
in high-level business decisions. The shifting
goalposts for ESG are making it even more
difficult for companies to gauge what their
reporting requirements will be. The more that
disclosure requirements differ between
jurisdictions such as the EU and the US, the
more expensive and time-consuming they will
become.
What can you do?

Organizations may lack the experience, capabilities
and skills needed to manage geopolitical risk
exposures and anticipate the ESG challenges these
can create.",0,0
"Given the growing set of social expectations that consumers
place on executives, management should communicate thoughtfully,
openly, and proactively with staff to avert reputational consequences.
This is especially true for global brands and multinationals, which may
have to navigate different wage-setting conditions across countries.
When budget constraints are binding, flexibility and responsiveness
may go a long way toward retaining talent. If firms cannot fully
satisfy workers' wage demands, offering other benefits, such as more
flexible working times or additional leave, can communicate
commitment to staff. Building company culture and providing more
intensive feedback and trainingparticularly for early-career
employees and new-joiners can also help to improve cohesion.
Strategic deals to unlock value amidst high inflation and rising
capital cost
Current market conditions, technological disruption and geopolitically
driven economic headwinds make executing deals and value creation
more important but also more complex than ever before. What's more,
this disruption impacts buyers and sellers in different ways, making the
process less clear.
Against this backdrop, dealmakers should proactively design new
investment strategies to focus on value creation and productivity to
secure sustainable long-term returns.",0,0
"Indeed, M&A activity flourished in
the enterprise IT sector in 2022, with DevOps and cloud transactions

technologies, including AI and machine learning.22 Additionally, alliances
and joint venture partnerships present alternate pathways to grow
market and revenue footprint. At the same time, to enhance margins

leaders may consider divesting their non-core assets to become leaner

"There followed a drought

Even before the invasion of Ukraine, energy prices had

had seen demand surge, while supply chain blockages

consumed in the bloc8 came from Russia, including 40%
of its natural gas9. Unsurprisingly, the energy crisis ranks
highly among European businesses in this year's Allianz
Risk Barometer, at #3 (32% of responses), compared to #4
globally (22%), #8 in the Americas (14%) and Africa and
the Middle East (16%), and #10 in Asia Pacific (11%).",0,0
"However, strikes, riots and civil commotion
(SRCC) also score highly, representing the real risk these
present to businesses. Recent years have shown the huge
impact a coordinated violent SRCC event can have on
an economy and politics, such as the Black Lives Matter
protests in the US or the South Africa Zuma riots of 2021,
while in 2023 the rising cost of living could also bring an
increased risk of disruption from such events.
Developing de-risking actions
There is little doubt that recent disruptions have increased
awareness around BI and supply chain risk and that
companies and governments are taking action to build
resilience and de-risk.
The Allianz Risk Barometer results show that companies
have begun to diversify their businesses and supply chains,
as well as stepping up risk management. More time and
money is being invested into looking into and documenting
the supply chain strategies of businesses. Companies that
have suffered disruption are now improving transparency
and data on supply chain risks.",0,0
"This has led to record capital
outflows from markets with weaker macroeconomic

October last year.21
Growth agendas, including the critical pivot to
greener economies, have been based on the
availability of cheap debt. The extent to which
countries can continue to finance development
will be dependent on domestic political and debt
dynamics. Sri Lanka's recent crisis provides a very
real example of the spiraling risks to human security
and health that can arise from economic distress,
where a debt default and shortage in foreign
currency limited imports; disrupted access to food,
fuel, healthcare and electricity; and led to violent
protests and the resignation of the President.
The scale of sovereign debt defaults could
significantly rise in weaker emerging markets over
the next two years, in terms of both the percentage
value of total global debt and number of states in
default (Figure 1.6).",0,0
"From physical
to digital risks
Most recently, the booming IT
sector has seen rapid growth
in products to insure against cyber
risks initially geared towards IT
companies managing systems used
by other businesses, but
increasingly wide in scope. The
parallels with the 1600s are clear:
just as economic value and ways
of doing business shifted then from
land to sea, they are shifting now
from the physical to virtual in both
cases creating new uncertainties,
and innovations from insurers
to support people in managing
the unfamiliar risks they face.
Similarly, after the 9/11 attacks
resulted in one of the largest
pay-outs in global insurance history,
insurers in the US and other
countries partnered with
governments to share risks
of compensation for future acts
of terrorism.
Sometimes this has involved finding
new ways of working together.
As fear of nuclear catastrophe rose
in the 1950s, for example, insurers
faced the challenge that a nuclear
incident in any given country could
overwhelm that country's insurance
industry yet people still wanted
to buy insurance against nuclear
risks. The solution was to pool risks
internationally. Today 300
companies in 31 countries pool
their capacities in this way(4).",1,0
"A final note regarding the focus on supply chain costs: Keep
in mind that when disruptions strike, a just-in-time inventory
strategy fails to provide an accurate tabulation of the cost
of goods sold. It does not account for expenses related to
business continuity management, logistics adjustments,
delays and unhappy customers, and long-term damage to
brand reputation and the customer experience. It also tends
to neglect the significant value derived from designing and
operating more reliable and resilient supply chains. Indeed,
a focus on resiliency and optimization can pivot the view of
supply chain from a cost center to a revenue driver.
Overall economic conditions, including ongoing inflationary
pressures, represent the second-highest-ranked risk
issue for the industry group, moving into the ""Significant
Impact"" risk category for 2023. Given the ongoing concerns
regarding inflation and potential recessionary trends, which
directly impact costs for materials and transportation,
leadership within manufacturing and distribution
organizations are keeping a close eye on the markets and
potential impact on their organizations and global supply
chains in the coming year.
Labor, talent and skills also are critical areas of concern
for manufacturing and distribution organizations.",0,0
"Ranking fifth is the concern that the
organization's ""approach to managing ongoing demands on
or expectations of a significant portion of our workforce
to 'work remotely' or increased expectations for a
transformed, collaborative hybrid work environment"" could
undermine the company's ability to retain valued talent.
These risks are intertwined and energy companies are
certainly not unique in trying to decide how and if they can
accommodate remote or hybrid work arrangements for
employees for the long term. Also, like many businesses,
they are finding out the hard way that taking an inflexible
stance toward working remotely can worsen recruiting and
retention issues. Realistically, many jobs in the energy and
utilities industry can't be performed from a home office.
However, that doesn't mean employers in the space can't 152
URL
work with employees in these roles to create more flexible
schedules or compensate them with other benefits such as
more paid time off.
Looking more closely at the fourth-ranked risk on the
2023 list for this industry, another potential driver is
around merger and acquisition (M&A) activities making
it more difficult for energy companies to sustain their
organizational culture and business model.",0,0
"M&A activity
is rising as energy firms look to grow their business and/or
jump-start or expand their interests in renewable energy.
To prevent the loss of critical human capital due to post

handle the integration process with great care, prioritizing
communication and employee engagement from the outset.
Overview of top risk issues for 2032
As noted earlier, energy and utilities executives anticipate
that ""the rising threat associated with catastrophic natural
disasters and weather phenomena"" from wildfires to
floods to hurricanes will be the top risk for their firms
through the next decade.
Another operational risk, ""resistance to change,"" holds
second place on the top five list for 2032. That isn't
surprising, given that this risk is typically in our top five and
holds the sixth spot for 2023.",0,1
"That list is based on each risk's overall average score (using our 10-point scale).

Table 8 shows the risks with the biggest differences
between the 2023 and 2032 scores, with all of them
reflecting declines in risk scores from 2023 to 2032. Not
surprisingly, the two risks with the biggest differences

these results suggest that the respondents believe these

this year are noticeably higher than last year, respondents
are less concerned about interest rates a decade from
now, suggesting that they may perceive that market forces
contributing to the current interest rate environment
will likely stabilize over time (which in turn may lead to
more favorable central bank policies). That same rationale
may also explain decreases in long-term concerns related

"But, as central banks
drain excess system-wide liquidity, and trading volumes
even in historically liquid markets decline, financial
accidents need to be watched out for. With rising rates,
financial stability risks are back, complicating the task
for central bankers who are determined to fight inflation
and make sure that it does not become entrenched. While
the current hiking path is about to moderate, central
banks' independence will be tested either way, whether
it's erring on the side of keeping their monetary stance
more restrictive for longer despite a looming recession,
or throwing in the towel too early and risking stagflation
for good.
So if monetary policy is preoccupied with fighting inflation,
could fiscal policy step into the breach? At the moment,
it looks very much like a new policy mix, with fiscal policy
taking over the old role of monetary policy in stimulating
demand. Finance ministers are outbidding each other in
announcing ever new billions in relief measures for the
cost-of-living crisis and industrial policies. But in view of
the already record-high debts and rapidly rising interest
rates, the scope for fiscal policy is rapidly narrowing.",0,0

WHO WILL BUILD THE
CAR OF THE FUTURE?
Technology has spearheaded an evolution in nearly every
part of the automobile. From lane departure warnings
and electric engines to automatic braking sensors and
entertainment and navigation consoles, the automobile
of 2023 is hardly recognizable when compared to
its 1923 predecessor.
But the design and assembly process for creating cars has
remained similar to that of a Model T. A single company
designs and assembles the final product today just like
Henry Ford did.
As technology companies both collaborate and
compete with traditional automotive companies, that
model is beginning to shift to something closer to the
way technology products are manufactured. Some
companies will continue to design and assemble
themselves, but newer automotive companies will likely
bifurcate the process.
We will likely start to see one company research and
design the product before partnering with a contract
manufacturer to create the final product.",0,0

Inflation-driven threats lead the
list of evolving external pressures
Various external factors are weighing on the industry agenda for 2023. Ongoing supply chain disruption,
rising energy costs and the current cost-of-living crisis continue to overshadow telcos' financial stability. Within
these, geopolitical issues are also having a significant impact, with populism and economic nationalism on the
rise, fueling protectionism, and 5G finding itself at the center of a technology ""cold war"" as industrial policies
become increasingly nuanced.
Crucially, telcos remain under pressure in the current high-inflation environment. Enterprise revenues are
more exposed than consumer revenues to macroeconomic weakness, reflecting the experience from previous
downturns. Even so, consumer services are still prone to spending cutbacks, particularly service bundles
that incorporate content and streaming services.",0,0

Porous compliance practices in the use of personal devices can lead to steep costs. A
well-publicized settlement with major banks over the use of WhatsApp for work-related
communications led to over $1.8 billion in fines from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 34 Around the

Memo laid out the expectation that any company regardless of industry or location
