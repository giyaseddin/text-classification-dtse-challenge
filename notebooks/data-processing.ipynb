       "[\"On the other hand,\\nrespondents to last year's survey noted growing concerns\\nabout the interest rate environment and ability to compete\\nfor talent in a highly competitive and unusual labor market.\\nThis year's survey results largely cemented those concerns\\nas inflation continued to accelerate and central banks\\naggressively raised interest rates and unwound monetary\\nstimulus programs in response. As a result, the likelihood\\nof a global economic recession increased. At the same\\ntime, and somewhat unusually given softening economic\\nconditions, most financial institutions are still understaffed\\nand struggling to attract and retain talent.\\nAccordingly, the overall 2023 top risks were generally\\nconsistent with those noted last year. Concerns about the\\ninterest rate environment ranked as the top risk in both\\n2023 and 2022. Four of the top five risks from last year\\nremained in the top five this year, although a few traded\\nplaces. Surprisingly, the risk tied to inflation and economic\\nconditions more broadly dropped from second to third, and\\nthe average score for this risk fell slightly as well.\",\n",
